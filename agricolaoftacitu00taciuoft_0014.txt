and rank (aetate et dignitate propemodum aequales).”
The question is how far aequales must be considered
to be modified by propemodum. We think the word
should be taken to imply a considerable difference.
Pliny himself says, “When I was a very young man
(adolescentulus) and you were at the height of your
fame and reputation, I earnestly desired to imitate
you.'’ Adolescentulus is a very vague term, but Pliny
may be taken to define this application of it to himself
when he tells us (Epist. v. 8) that he was in his nine-
teenth year when he began to speak in the F orum.
He was, as he tells us himself (Epist. VI. 20), in his
eighteenth year when the famous eruption of Vesuvius
took place (A. D. 79), and he must therefore have been
born A.D. 61 or 62. We are inclined to put the
date of the birth of Tacitus at least ten years earlier.
In this conclusion we are supported by the passage
which we find in the third chapter of the Effe os
Aqm‘cola. There he speaks of those who had survived
the evil days of Domitian as coming under two
classes, the young men who had become old, the old
‘who had advanced to the very verge and end of
existence? He must have included himself in the
former class. The Aym'cola was published before the
death of Nerva but after the adoption of Trajan, i.e.
in the latter part of the year 97. It may surprise us
that Tacitus could have spoken of himself as being
then an old man. But the term senior was technically ’
applied at Rome (Aul. Gellius, x. 28, quoting Tubero)
to those who had passed their sorny-fifth year. And
G. Cotta (in a speech to the people preserved to us in
one of the fragments of Sallust) speaks of himself, he
being then forty-eight, as an old man. If Tacitus
was fifty in A. 1). 97, he must have been born Α. D. 47 ς
