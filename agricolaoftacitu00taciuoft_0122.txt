92 CORNELII TAOITI AGRIOOLA.

1²· Grande solatium tulit] ‘Solatium ἔθη-θ’ may be a ’ς
similar expression to ‘palmam ferre ' (where ferre is for referre), in ᾗ
which case ‘ solatium ' must be rendered by ‘ compensationss Or κ

(as Wex takes it) it may mean, ⁸ he brought us great consolation Α
for his premature death‚⁷ &m διο. ’

13· SpiramentaL Sc· ‘pauses’

14. Uno ictu] So Caligula was said to have wished that
the Roman people had one neck, that he might have destroyed
them at a blow. Comp. Senec. de Ira, 111. ¹9·

15. Rem publicam exhausit] ‘ Drained the life-blood
of the state :¹ or ‘exhausit’ may be used as ⁴ hausisse’ in Hist. 1.
41, ‘to inflict a deadly wound,’ jugulum ejus hausisse,

CHAPTER XLV.

1. Non vidit eto] There is a marked resemblance be·
tween this passage and Cic. de Orat. 111. 2, Non vidit (L. Crassus)
flagrantem bello Italiam, nou ardentem invidia senatum, non
sceleris nefarii principes civitatis reos.

2. Obsessam...senatum.] These words point to some one
occurrence, of which we know nothing from any other source.

in a similar fashion.

3. Consularium caedes] Suetonius (Domft. x.) gives a
list of these murders, with the frivolous causes which provoked

them. Among them were Civica Cerialis, proconsul of Asia ;
Sallustius Lucullus, governor of Britain ; Salvius Cocceianus,

nephew of the Emperor Oth03 J unius Rusticus; the younger
Helvidius, &a &c-

4· Nobilissimarum feminarum] Among these were
Gratilla, the wife of Arulenus Rusticus; Arria, the wife of

Thrasea3 Fannia, his daughter, who twice accompanied her hus-
band iuto exile, and was a third time banished on his account.
See Plin. Epp. 111. 11, vn. 19.

5- Una adhuc victoria censebatur] ‘As yet (at the
time of Agricola’s death) by one and only one victory was Carus

Metius distingui-hed) ‘Censeri' is equivalent to ‘ aestirnari,‘ and
its precise meaning is that Metius’s power for mischief was as yet
estimated by but one successful information. It is thus used
Dial. 39, ejusmodi libri extant ut ipsi quoque qui egerunt non
aliis magis orationibus censeantur, and Plin. Paney. 15, quisquis
paullo vetustior miles, hic te commilitone censetur. The name of
the notorious ‘delator' Caius Metius meets us Plin. Epp. VII. 19,
5, vn. 27, 14, JuV. L 35, Mart. ΧΠ. 25. 5.

6. Albanam arcem‚] This was one of Domitian’s country
