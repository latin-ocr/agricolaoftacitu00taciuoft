7. Tenentibus arma, plerisque, ὅσα] ⁴1·ka many

held πως] διο, This clause is parenthetical.

8. Praepius...tim0r.] ‘Propius’ (the reading ofthe Mss. ³

for which W ex and Kritz read proprius) seems defensible, though
no doubt ‘propior' is what wo should have expected. It must

be construed with ‘agitabatff ‘Fear from the legatus (sc. sear ψ

of which he was the source) was more urgently harassing
them,’ &c. διο. Punishment to those who were conscious of the
guilt of rebellion seemed more imminent than to others.

9, Ni quamquam, ὅσα] This is the reading of Orelli and
Wex. The passage is difficult and confused. The objection to

the reading ne quamquam, διο. is that it obliges us either to take
the words eyn-emus cetera as expressing the Britom’ opinion about
Paulinus, which Tacitus would hardly have eared to mention,
or else, as very obscurely and clumsily interposed. We have,
in fact, but a choice of difficulties, and the reading adopted
appears to prese-:t the least. Reading ‘ni’ we should give the
meaning thus3 ‘He would have brought the province back, ὅτε.
had he not been disposed thus to act!

,‚13· Compositis prioribus] comp. Arm. 1. 45, compo-
sztcs praesentibus. Prwra refers to the late outbreak of the

Britons and its suppression by Paulinus. There would still be
much lingering irritation and discontent in Britain3 this, Petro-
Εἰέἕε allayed, and thus effectually restored peace and tranquil-

14. Trebellio Maximo] Oomp. Hist. 1. 60. Trebellius
was governor of Britain from A. n. 64 to 69.

15· Nullis castrorum experimentis-J ‘A man with no
actual expenence of campalgns.'

16· curandi] ‘ Curare ' is used both of military coinmande

and of civil administration. Comp. Arm. XI. 22, duo additi
(quaestores) qui Romae curarent.

17· Ignoscere vitiis blandientibus] ‘To show insul-
gence to vices as they became attractive? It is best, we thmk,

to take ‘vitiis' as a dative. Com p. Ch. 21, paullatim discessum ad
delenimenta vitiorum.
