not like a regular cavalry engagement, as it was fought on sloping
ground, on which they could barely keep their footing. On such
ground ton, the infantry would be peculiarly liable to be thrown
down by the pressure of the cavahy horses which were drawn up
among them. Wex’s ingenious conjecture ‘aequa nostris ea jam
pugnae facies erat,’ does not appear to be absolutely required.

10. Transversos aut obvios] These words are, probably,
to be referred to the Romans. Lipsius, however, understood

them of the Britons.

OHAPTER XXXVII.

1. Vacui] This means much the same as ‘securi.’ Here,
as frequently, the less usual word is preferred b y Tacitus.

2. Ad subita belli] ‘For the sudden emergencies of
war? The same phrase occurs Hist. V. 13.

3. Ferocius] The word implies the notion of ‘dash’ and
‘ impetuosity.'

4. In ipsos versum] ‘Recossed upon themselves) The
Britons who tried to take the Romans in rear, were themselves

thus attacked.

5· Aversam hostium aciem] Sc. ‘the enemy's rear.’

6. Tum vero, ὅσα] Tacitus, as Lipsius was the first to
point out, seems to have had in his mind the following passage
from Sallust, Juy. 101: tum spectaculum horribile campis pa-
tentibus; sequi, sugere, occidi capi, equi, viri afflicti; ac multi
vulneribus acceptis neque fugere posse neque quietem pati, niti
modo ac statim concidere3 postremo omnia qua visus erat con-
strata telis, armis, cadaveribus, et inter ea humus infecta sau-
guine. With the words ‘aliquando etiam victis ira virtus’ may
be compared Virg. Aen. 11. 367, quondam etiam victis redit in
praecordia virtus.

7. Collecti...ignaros.] This from the time of Puteolanus
has been the common reading, andis adhered to by Orelli. lt
does not appear to have been satisfactorily emended by the efforts
of recent editors. Something stands in the MSS. before ‘collecti,'
which Ritter conjectures to be inde, Halm (whom Kritz follows)
more ingeniously, identidem, which conveys the idea of repeated
sudden attacks made by the fiying army on the pursuers. The
general sense of the passage is clear enough, but we can hardly
hope to restore the original with precision.
