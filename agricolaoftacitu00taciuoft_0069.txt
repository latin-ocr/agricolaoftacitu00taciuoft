Both grandfathers were probably Procurators under Augustus,
the latha· having been made a &nator by Tiberius.

3· Quae equestris nobilitas est] There is spme
difficulty about these words. Wex considers them to be spurious

on the ground that really distinguished equites, such as are
called primores equitum (Hm. 1. 4) and equites dignitate senatoria
(Anu. xvx. 17), looked down upon the office of Procurator. In
support of this view he quotes the latter passage which seems
to imply that Mela, who was an eques dignitate Senatoria, was
thought to have acted strangely when he accepted a Procurator-
ship for the sake of making a speedy fortune. Kritz, on the other
hand, affirma that the office was bestowed only on the more dis-
tinguished membem οἱ the equestrian order. If the words are
genuine they must mean that the circumstance of having one or
both grandfathers a Procurator constituted equestrian nobility.
The term ‘nobflis’ was opposed to ‘novus hom0‚’ and'meant
strictly a man whose father or aneestor had risen to a curule
magistraey. The dignity of a Proeuratorship would constitute a
corresponding ‘nobilitas' among the equites.
