60 CORNELII TAOITI AGRIGOLA.

16. Prout prima, cessissent] ¹ In proportior: as his first ·
attempts had succeeded) Oomp. Hist. 11. 20, gnarus, ut initia

&effi provenissent, famam in cetera fore. ‘Prima' here=initia
e -

matured plans.’

cision, c.
¹9· Quibus nota vada] Agricola's auxiliaries (among
whom. as appears from Ch. 36, were Batavians) could hardly
bave known these particular aeas, so that by ‘vada’ it seems best
to understand ‘ shallows‚ fords ' generally. The Batavians were
famous swimmem, as we leam Hisc. lv. 12, Ann. 11. 8. We
must suppose that the channel separating Anglesea from the
main land must have undet-gone a great change since that period.

23- Aestimantibus..tacuisset] ‘In the eyes of those

have been silent about such great deeds.’ It seems best (with
Kritz) to take aestimantibus as a dative.

CHAPTER XIX.

1. Animorum provinciae prudens] ‘Weu acquaznted
with the temper of the province! ‘Prudens’ here=gnamm

Comp, Hist. 11. 25, Celsus doli prudens repressit suos. Possibly
in animorum there is the notion of high spirit, a meaning often
found in the plural of animus.

¹2. InjUriae] This is the correction of Puteolanus for

⁴ incuriae,⁴ which the MSS. have, and it is the reading of most ,

recent editors. Incuriae seems hardly defensible. The plural of
