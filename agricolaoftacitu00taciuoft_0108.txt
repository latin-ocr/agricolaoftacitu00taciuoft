78 CORNELII TAOH‘I AGRICOLA.

3. Si pellerentur] Se. ‘if the auxiliaries were repulsed? , ³

4- In speciem ac terrorem] Sc. with aview to an im-
posing appearance and to cause panio. ‘Species’ is used in a

similar way, Ch. 2 5, [classis]...sequebatur egregia specie.

5. Gonnexi] The MSS. fluctuate between connexi and
convexi. Connexi (the reading of Ritter and Kritz) implies that
the line of the Britons extended without a break up the slope of
the hill. Convexi, applied to this sloping formation, might be
harsh, but Kritz surely goes too far in pronouncing it absurd.
The word, however, does not seem to be much wanted.

6. Media campi] So. the space between the two armies.

7. Covinnarius eques] So the best MSS. and the most
recent editors. The phrase must be simply equivalent to ‘ covin-
narii,’ which word occurs in th'e following chapter. The word
‘ covinnus,' according to Pomponius Mela (111. 6), denoted a
chariot armed with scythes. The Britons, it seemed, borrowed
it from the Belgae. Caesar, B. G. IV. 24 (where he describes this
mode of fighting), says nothing about the ehariots having scythes,
nor does he use the words ‘ covinnus‚’ ‘ covinnarii.’ He speaks of
‘essedarii’ (by which he meant the same thing), and he draws a.
distinction between them and regular cavalry (equitatus), which
he says the Britons also employed. Tacitus makes no such direct
allusion to cavalry; he merely tells us, Ch. 12, that some tribes
fought with the chariot, among whom, it appears, were the Gale-
donians.

8. Porrectior] ‘Too extended.’

9. Promptior in spem] Comp. 'Amen-xv. 25, promptus
in pavorem. Ib. 61, promptum in adulationes ingenium.

10. , Firmus adversis] ‘Resoluta under adverse eircum-
stances.

11. Ante vexilla] By ‘vexilla' is meant the same as in
Oh. 18, contractis legionum vexillis, where see note 13. Agricola
took his stand in front of the peditum auxilia, mentioned above,
among which would be several bodies of troops, termed vexilla.

CHAPTER XXXVI.

1. Constantia] Sc. calm, sels-possessed eoum-ge.

α. GetrisJ The ‘cetra' was a small leathern shield, like
the pelta. It appears from Livy xxm. 36 that ‘cetrati’ and
‘ peltastae’ were convertible terms.
