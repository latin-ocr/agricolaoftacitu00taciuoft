NOTES. 75

‘Senes’ in allusion to the ‘veterana’ by whom the coloniae
were usually garrisoned.

11. Aegra municipia] This is in apposition with ‘senum
coloniae! 'lhe word ‘aegra’ denotes the feebleness arising from
interpal discord. Comp. its use Hist. 11. 86, movere et quatere
quidquid usquam aaeyrum foret, adgrediuntur. (The Greek νοσεῖν
is used in precisely the same way. Soph. El. 1070, τὰ. μὲν ἐκ
δόμων νοσεῖ.) Comp. also claudian, Bell. Get. 4 37, vivusque color
redit urbibus aeyris. Londinium and Verulamium had the cha.-
racter of ‘municipia‚’ that is, they had their own ‘senatus,' and
their own officere for the administration of justice. ‘ Municipia’
appears to us on the whole a better reading than that of ‘ man-
cipia’ which Wex and Kritz adopt from the margin of one of tho

5. Octavus annus] Agricola was now entering on his
8th year in Britain.

·6. Virtute et auspiciis imperii Romani] The ‘aus-
picia’ from the time of AugustuS, properly speaking, belonged
to the Emperor. Tacitus here affecte the old republican form of
speech. He may naturally have shrunk from any such allusion
to Domitian, as the word imperatoris would have involved.
When ‘ductus’ and ‘auspicia' are used in close connexion, the
first denotes the general's conduct of a campaign, the second the
