62 CORNELII TACITI AGRIOOLA.

cunning methods of extortion to which Roman governors had
been in the habit of resorting in districts scantily furnished with

corn. Instead of aceepting a money—equivalent for the ‘fru-

mentum imperatum‚’ they compelled the Britons to purchase

corn from the Roman granaries up to the required amount. Of
course they could fix their price, and had the purchasers at their
mercy. The corn would thus be often bought at an excessive
price, and when bought it still remained in the Roman granaries,
so that the whole affair was a ‘ ludibrium.’ Hence the Britons
are said (1) ‘emere ultro frumenta,' that is, to buy corn need-
lessly and under very provoking circumstances, and (α) ‘ludere
pretio‚' a phrase which has been variously interpreted, but which
seems to mean, ‘to be going through a fax-ce with the price,‘
inasmuch as they were paying dear for what after all the sellet-
kept in his possession. Wex's conjecture ‘luere’ for ‘ludere'
which he explains by ‘luere imperata' ignores the ordinary
usage of ‘luere' which requires to be followed by an accusative
of the object. In Livy, xxx. 37, the reading (‘pecunia luere')
which he quotes is doubtful. Kritz reads ‘recludere,' and ex-
plains the passage as meaning that the Britons had to buy their
corn out of the granaries and then shut it up (i. e. see it shut up)
again in them. But this use of ‘ recludere' is very questionable.

12- Devortia itinerum-deferrent] ‘Places lying out
of the regular roads and distant parts of the country were ap-

pointed, in order that states, with winter camps close to them,
might have to convey corn into remote and out of the way dis-
tricts.’ Here we have another method of Roman extortion,
applicable to the corn-gyrowinq districts. The inhabitants, finding
it troublesome and costly to carry their corn to a distance, would
be glad to commuto the required contribution for a money pay-
ment fixed by the governor. This device is specially mentioned
in the Verrine Speeches, 111. 82, Instituerunt semper ad ultima.
ac difficillima loca apportandum frumentum imperare ubi vec-
turae difficultate ad quam vellent aestimationem pervenirent.
