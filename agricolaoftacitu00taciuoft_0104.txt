74 CORNELII TA 011⁷] AGRIOOLA.

would have brought us—in which case we should have ultimately
cause for regret (poenitentia) that we had successfully resisted
for a while. It appears to us that the words as they stand will
fairly bear this interpretation, and that there is no nee-d of Wex's
emendation, in libertatem no‘n in poenitentiam arma laturi,
though, of course, it makes the passage somewhat easier, aud
introduces the familiar phrase ‘ferre arma?

14. Seposuerit] ‘Has in reserve.' Comp. Germ. 29, in
usum praeliorum sepositi.

CHAPTER XXXII.

1. Nisi] Orelli after the MSS. nisi si. But (as Wex
points out) where, as here, the word has an ironical force and
suggests an absurd alternative, it is never followed by si. ‘Nisi
si’ would imply that the alternative was possible and reasonable.

2. Gommodent] The MSS. have commendent, for which
Puteolanus (whom nearly all modern editors follow) substituted
‘ commodent‚’ which preoisely suits this passage. Comp. Livy,
xxxw. 12, quamquam vereatur ne suas vires, aliis eas commo-
dando, minuat.

3· Infirma vincla loco caritatis] Kritz reads ‘loco'
from his own conjecture. The word seems to be wanted, as sear

and terror (metus ac terror) cannot well be said to be bonds os
affection. The meaning clearly is, that they take the place of it.

4. Nulla plerisque patria] This would necessarily be
the case in an army made up of various nations whose separate
existence had been destroyed by conquest.

5- Trepidos ignorantia] By ‘ignorantia’ is meant
specially ignorance of the country in which they were fighting.

6. Circumspectantes] The notion of the word circum-
spectare is that of looking round timidly and suspiciously. This
is weu illustrated in Cic. Tusa. 1. 30, 73, Itaque dubitans, cir-
cumspectans, haesitans, multa adversa reverenS, tamquam rate
in mari immenso nostra vehitur oratio.

7. Vinctos‚] Comp. Arm. 1. 62, eodem fato vznctac legi-
ones, and Hist. 1. 79, Sarmatae...velut vincti caedebantur.

8. Nostras manus] Sc. troops who in heart are with us

9. Agnoscent Britanni] Sc. Britone, compelled to fight
as levies in the Roman army.

10· Senum coloniae] Oomp. Ch. 5, incensae coloniae.
