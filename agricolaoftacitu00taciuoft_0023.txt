the military colony of Camulodunum (Colchester) was
established in ΑΛ). 50. From this time the southern

During the following years the country was gradually
Romanised, and the colonies of Camulodunum, Veru-

the insurrection of Boudicea recovered their position.
Vespasian’s reign from A. D. 69 to 79, saw the work of
conquest still further advanced under Cerialis and his
successor Frontinus. The Silures in South Wales and
