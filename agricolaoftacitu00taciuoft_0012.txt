List of Editions and Translations of the Agricola and
Germania of Tacitus which have been consulted
by the present Editors. [This list is confined
to works of the present century.]

J. Aikin, 1823· Translation of the Agricola and Germania
with notes. 4th Edition. This is a work designed rather sor
general readers than for scholare and studente.

G. Roth, 1833. Edi-tion of the Agricola, with learned and
copious German notes, which are however hardly adapted to ordi-
nary students.

P. Frost, 1847. Edition of the Agricola and Germania, with
English notes. It is suitable for the use of schools, but is now
rather out of date.

Dr Latham, 1851. Edition of the Germania, for studente of
philoiogy and ethnology. Oritical and grammatical difficulties
are not discussed.

F. G. Wex, 1852. Edition of the Agricola, with a tho·
roughly revised text, Prolegomena, in which every difficult and
corrupt passage is fully discussed, and Latin notes. This is the
most valuable of all recent editions of the Agricola, and is the
result of most laborious researoh.

F. Ο. WeX, 1852. Edition of the Agricola for the use of
Schools, without the Prolegomena and with the notes of the
larger edition translated into German.

M. Haupt, 18 5 5. Edition of the Germania, with a new and
carefully revised text, for the use of schools.

W. Smith, 1855. Edition of the Agricola and Germania,
with English notes, which are chiefly taken from Ruperti and
Passow, and with Boetticher’s essay on the style of Tacitus.

A J. Henrichsen, 1855. German translation of the Agricola
only partially complete.

W. S. Tyler, 1857. Edition of the Agricola and Germania,
with English notes, drawn srom the best commentators, and

with a life of Tacitus. Published ast N ew York. This is a use· ,

ful edition, but the notes are rather too diffuse.

Kritz, 1859. Edition οἱ the Agricola, mainly based upon
Wex, with Latin notes.

Kritz, 1860. Edition of the Germania, mainly based upon
Haupt, with Latin notes.

[Both these editions we have found very useful.]
