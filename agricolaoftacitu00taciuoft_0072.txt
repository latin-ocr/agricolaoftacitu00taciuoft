42 CORNELII TAGH'I AGRIOOLA.

9· Trucidati veterani] Comp. ch. 16, where Boadicea's
attack on Camulodunum is described. Some veterans appear to

have been settled in this colony. It was, in fact, the only real
colonia in Britain, but the word is used loosely of important
towns3 comp. note on aeyra municipia, ch. 3²·

10. Interseptffl Armies would be said to be ‘intersepti’
when they were prevented from joining the main body; comp.
Hist. 111. 5 3, Inter-septa Germanorum Rhaetorumque auxilia.
We have followed the reading of the MSS. though perhaps
intercepti, ‘ cut off ’ or ‘surprisedss gives a sense agreeing better
with the description of the revolt.

11. Cessit in ducem] ‘ Fell to the share of the general.'

¹¹2· Temporibus] It is best to take this as a dative de-
pending on ingrata.. Kritz considers it to be an ablative, though
he quotes ch. 31, ‘ virtus subjectorum i‘nyrata imperantibus?

132 Quibus sinistra...interpretatio.] Kritz. would Βιψ-
ply ‘eJus, z. e. ‘militaris gloriae,’ and render in which there is,
in the case of eminent men, a sinister interpretation put on
military glot-y. This seems far-fetched and disproved by the
position of ‘sinisti-aff It is better to join the word to ‘erga
eminent-es!

CHAPTER VI.

1. Hinc] Sc. ‘ from or after these services.'

’Ξ Natalibus] ‘Lineage,’ a post-Augustam use of the
wor

3. Decus] ‘Distinotion.’ The word here means the re-
fleeted lustro that comes to a man from great connections.

4. Per mutuam caritatem] Orelli takes ‘ per' to signify
time, as if ‘in continuone mutual affection’ was meant. It seems

better to take it as causaL Their affection was the cause of their
singular harmony.

5. ‘Nisi quod ...... laus] ‘However, the good wife de-
serves the greater praise' (0 and B). ‘Nisi quod’ is Tacitus’

comment on the praise which he has been bestowing on Agricola
in the previous sentence. He guards himself from being supposed
to say that the husband and wife deserve equal commendation. In
his view the good wife deserves more.

6. Sors quaesturae] The Quaestors were appointed, and
then drew lots for their destinations.

7. Salvius Titianus] He was the elder brother of M.
Otho, afterwards Emperor. Comp. Hist. 1. 75, 77.
