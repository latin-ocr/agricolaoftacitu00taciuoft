xiv NOTES ΟΝ THE LIFE ΛΝΒ

The Dialoyus de Oratore, which we have no hesitav-
Δ tion in ascribing to the pen of Tacitus, was probably
an early work. The expression which we find in ch. 17,
“sextam jam felicis hujus principatus stationem qua
Vespasianus rem publicam fovet,” may not be intended
to do more than fix the date of the imaginary conver-
sation3 but the passage indicates a more favourable
opinion of the Emperor than he seems to have enter-
tained in after years. (See Hice. 11. 84, 111. 34, dac.)
The Ayricola was published towards the close of
A.D. 975 the Ger-many in the following year. The
History may with probability be ascribed to some year
between A.D. 103 and 106. Avery interesting letter of
Pliny’s (Epist. 1x. 27) very probably refers to it. It
was still, we knOW, in course of preparation when his
Epistles V1. 16, 20 and V11. 33 were written. The first
and second of these describe the famous eruption of
Vesuvius, and were written at the historian’s request.
The third relates some particulars as to the prosecution
of Baebius Massa in which Pliny had taken a part
which he was anxious to have recorded. “Auguror‚’'
he writes, “historias tuas immortales futuras 5 quo
magis illis (ingenue fatebor) inseri oupi0.’' The publi-
cation of the Annals must be referred, as has before
been said, to the close of Trajan’s reign. Reference is
made in Ann. XI. 11 to the History as an earlier work,
“libris quibus res Domitiani imperatoris composui.”
The two contained together thirty books, as we learn
from S. J erome on Zachariah, ch. xm„ and related the
events of about 70 years from the death of Augustus
to the accession of Nerva. It is probable that Tacitus
found, it expedient to abandon the intention, an-
nounced in Hice. 1. 1, of writing the history of the
reigns of Nerva and Trajan. The records of an extinct
