WRITINGS OF TAOITUS. xv

fertile! Accordingly we find him (Anu. 111. 24) resolved,
if his life should be prolonged, to choose another theme
in a still earlier period, the reign of Augustus.

The letters addressed by the younger Pliny to
Tacitus are the following: Ι. 6, 20 3 lv. 13 ; vx. 9, 16,

’ 20 3 vu. 20, 333 vm. 7 3 1x. 10, 14. of these the
