N OTES. 95

“ 5· Si natura suppeditet] Sc. if our natural powers are
oqual to the task.

6. Decoremus] ‘Let us honour.’ Comp. Ennius quoted
by Cicero (Tusc. 1. 15, 34), Nemo me lacrimis decoret nec funera

fietu Faxit.

³ 7. For-mamque ac figuram] Formam is the correction
x of Muretus for famam, the reading of the MSS.. and is accepted

5thy nearly all editors. comp. Cic. Tusa. 1. 16, 37, animorum
ism-mam aliquam atque fiquram quaerebant. Tacitus uses the
‘phrase to denote the whole mind and character of Agricola.
Pliny also uses it in connection with a very similar sentiment

⁷ (Paney. 55), sormam principis fiquramque non aurum melius
vel argentum quam favor hominum exprimat teneatque.

, 8. Non quia...putem.] ‘Not because Ι think a. veto
ought to be put on,' ἅτε. ‘intercedere’ is strictly said of tlte

tribunitian veto. The subjunctive implies‚ ‘I am not one to ,
think,’ &c.

9. Forma mantis] ‘Mens’ here = animus, and stands
for the entire mental and spiritual being.

ιο. Tenere et exprimere] ‘Retain and represent!

11. Alienam materiam et artem] Sc. marble οι·
bronze, and the art of sculpture, which are necessarily foreign

(alanus) to the truest and best representation of human cha·
rac r.

1> 12. In aeternitate temporum] ‘In the eternal succes-
l· sion of the ages! (0 and B.)

> 13. Fama rerum] In the recorda of history, or more
generally, ‘ the fame that waits on noble deeds? <0 and B.)

¹4· Obruit, This is Haupt's emendation for obruet, the

’ reading of the MSS. It has the merit of bringing out more

ἓ forcibly the antithesis between ‘ oblivio ² aud the words ‘narratus

ι’ et traditus.’ The allusion in ‘multos veterum’ is to the times of the

Ξ ublic, and the general sentiment may be compared with the

a well-known passage in Horace, 0. lv. 9. 25, Vixere fortes ante

’ memnona Multi3 sed omnes illacrimabiles Urguentur igno-

tique longa Nocte, carent quia vate sacro. Tacitus thus hints

ι more delicately at the effect of his work than he would do by
deum-ibing it as ‘laudes immortales.’
