94 CORNELII TAOI T I AGRICOLA.

13. Tu vero...m0rt.is.] So Cic. de Orat. 111. 3. Ego
vero, te, Crasse, quum vitae flore, tum mortis opportunitate

divino consilio et ortum et exstinctum esse arbitror.

ιέι. Constans et libens,] ‘With courage and cheerful-
ness-

15. Tamquam...d0nares,] ‘As though to the best of
thy power thou wert bestowing freedom from guilt on the em-

peror) The phrase ⁴ pro virili portione ’ (‘pa1te' and not ‘por-
tione’ is the word used by writers of the Augustan age) occurs
Hist. 111. 20, and denotes ‘all that a man can do singly.’ The
expression ‘innocentiam donares’ seems intended to suggest that
the emperor was not really innocent of Agricola's death. ,

16· Longae absentiae condicione-l ‘By the necessity
of a long absence? Tacitus is speaking of his own absence from

Rome.

17. Paucioribus lacrimis] Sc. ‘with too few tears.'

18. Compositus] The reading of the MSS. is ‘complo-
ratus) ‘ Commo-situs, however, is found in the margin of one of
the Vatican MSS„ and is read by all recent editors except Kritz.
It seems a far more suitable word than ‘comploratus‚’ which
savours too much of the noisy lamentatione which in the next
chapter Tacitus deprecates. Comp. Hist. 1. 47, Pisonem Verania
uxor et frater...composuere, and Hor. Sat. 1. 9, 28, omnes com·

posui.

. 19, Desideravere aliquid] ‘Longed for something in
valn-

CHAPTER XLVI.

.οΡ {31¹³th sapientibus placet] ‘As is believed by philo-

ι’.. Infirmo desiderio] ‘ Feeble regret‚' ‘infirmus' de·
noting what belongs to a morbid state of mind.

3· Lugeri--.plangi.] The first word expresses the senti-
ment οἳ grief, the second its outward manifestatione.

4· Quam temporalibus laudibus] ‘Quam’ is due to
Ursinus, and is certainly required if ‘ temporalibus ' (which is the

reading of the MSS.) be retained. The notion of temporales
laudes (transitory praises) is the ‘laudatio funebris? which would
be soon forgotteu. This, we believe, is what Tacitus had in his
mind. He himself, as Pliny (Epp. 11. 1. 6) tells us, pronounced
a funeral eloqe over Verginius Rufus. Lipsius (whom Ritter
follows) substituted from conjecture ‘immortalibus' for tempora-
libus ; but it would hardly have been in good taste for Tacitus to
apply such an epithet to the present work.
