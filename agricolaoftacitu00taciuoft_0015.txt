WRITINGS OF PAOITUS. xi

if an interval of fifteen years is thought too much
ts> be borne out by Pliny's propenwdum (eccum-ing,
vit must be remembered, in a 'complimentary letter,
and fmm its very employment implying no incon-
siderable differenee), we must not anyhow fix a later
ξ date than A.D. 51 or 52.

The town of Interamna (now Terni) in Umbria
bas been named as the birthplace of Tacitus There
-is no direct proof of the assez-tion, but it is known
*that this town was in the third century the seat of
the family of the Emperor Tacitus. This prince, who

· occupied the throne for a few months after the death
, of Aurelian Aa). 275, was accustomed to claim descent
from the historian, and honoured his memor-y by di-
recting that ten copies of his works should be annually
ἐζ tmnscribed and placed in the public libraries. ,
· If our conjecture as to the date of his birth be
’ correct, Tacitus must have attained the period of
<¹ youth in the great year (69) which witnessed the fall
of three Emperors. His descriptions of some of the
1* soenes of that time, among which we may specify the
⁸ entry of the Flavianist troops into Rome (Hv‘st. 111. 83),
look like the work of an eye-witness.

It has been suggested that Tacitus made the
acquaintance of Agricola at some time in the three

7 years (Am. 74—77) during which that officer held the
govemment of Aquitania. There is, it has been
thought, a particularity about his description of
{LssAgricola's administration which indicates the intimate
³2³] acquaintance of one who either held some official
position, or was otherwise closely connected with it.
This position may possibly have included something
of the intimate relation in which Agricola himself
aethe opening of his career had stood to Suetonius
