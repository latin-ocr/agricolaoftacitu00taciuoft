CHAPTER V.

’ 1- Prima castrorum rudimenta] ‘ His military appren-
ξ ticeship’ (U and B). ‘Castra’ is used for ‘military service‚' as

¹ in ch. 16, nullis castrorum experimentis.

α. Approbavit.] Sc. so sex-ved as to satisfy.

3. Suetonio Paullin0.] For Tacitus’ opinion of this
general comp. Hist. 11. 25, cunctator natura, &c.‚ and 11. 31,

ἶ nemo illa tempestate rei militaris callidior habebatur.

 

4- Contubemio aestimaret] ‘ Contubernio aestimare'
is to form a judgment os character by the opportunities of close

companionship. The practice may be compared to the relation
in which in our service an aide-de-camp stands to his general
officcr. Comp. Sall. Juy. 64, in contubernio patris militabat,
Hist. 1. 2 3, contubernales appellando, where Otho wishes to make
his military audience feel that there is a tie of intimacy between
himself and them.

5. Neque A ricola ...... rettulit] The general meaning
iss, that Agricola 'd not use the facilities afforded by his rank

either to procure enjoyment or escape from duty. His rank
(titulus) with one disposed to indulgence (expressed by licenter)
would have given opportunities for pleasure (voluptates). On the
other hand, hac. he been idly disposed (expressed by segniter),
his inexperience (inscitia), i. e. the fact that he was of little use,
would have made it easy to get leave of absence (commeatus).
‘ Rettulit' may be rendered by ‘employed with a view t0,' &e.;
‘referre ad aliquid’ being equivalent to our expression ‘to
refer to an end ;' comp. Plin. Epp. 1. 22, nihil ad ostentationem,
omnia ad conscientiam refert. For ‘commeatus’ comp. Ann.
xv. 10, reliquas legiones promiscuis commatibus infirmaverat.

6. Nihil appetere in jactationem] ‘To attempt nothing
for display’ <0 and B); or more exaetly, perhaps, ‘to seek for no

&amm a view to display ς’ ‘appetere' being opposed to

7. Anxius et intentus] ‘ Gareful and vigilant’ (G and B) ς
or ‘oareful and energetic.’ He was full of thought before the
time of action, and when the time was corne wholly occupied

with what he was doing. ‘Intentus' gives the idea of the full
teusion of energy.

8. ExcitatiorJ This is the conjecture of Buchner, which
we have followed Kritz in adoptmg instead of ‘ exercitatior? It

means ‘more excited,' and would seem the natural expression of

Tacitus in speaking of the native tribes3 exercitatior would apply
rather to the Roman province.
