N OTES. 61

incuria is nowhere found, nor does the idea of ‘official myli-
ἔπορ’ suit the context so well as that of oppression and in-
ustlce.

J {mn Domum suam] Sc. his servants and subordinatas

4. Nihil...pub1icae rei] ‘He transacted no public busi-
ness through freedmen aud slaves! Understand ‘ agere.’

5. Non studiis...ascire,] ‘He did not select his centu-
rions or attendant soldiers according to his own personal inclina-

tions or the recommendations or requests (of others).’ ‘Ascire‘
(due to Puteolanus for the reading of the MSS. nescire, which

,- Orelli retains and endeavours to explain) seems to be unquestion-

ably the right reading and is now generally adopted. By ‘ cen-

Λ tux-ionem, milites ' we are to understand the same as by ‘ centu-
s riones, manum (legati)‚‘ Ch. 15, where see note. ‘Ascire,' ex-
* pressing as it does deliberate choice and selection, is the word

required in such a connexion. Under the head of ‘attendant
soldiers' would be included lictors, appan'tors, clerks, secretaries,

purveyors of corn, διο. διο. These persons were eomprehended

under the common designation ‘ cohors accensorum.' and being

released from all strictly military duties were termed ‘benefici-

63 Non omnia exsequi] ‘He did not punish in every

7· Severitatem commodare] This is something like a
zeugma, though we find a similar use of ‘commodare’ Ovid,

Amores, 1. 8, 86, Commodat illusis numina surda Venus.

8- Nec poena...esse,] Construe ‘poena ’ as an ablative
depending on ‘contentus.' This, though a sort of zeugma, seems
better than joining it, as Kritz does, vn'th ‘ commodare.’

9. Aequalitate...munerum,] Munera denote the various
burdens imposed by the Romans on the Britons. These fell
under two heads, (ll contributions of corn, (2) the payment of
a money-tribute. The first would necessarily be vexatious in
districts where corn was scarce. For this difficulty Agricola
found a remedy by requiring in such cases as an equivalent pay-
ment the average price which corn fetehed in parts where it was
more plentiful. This was done by means of an assessment‚
‘aestimatio frumenti,’ as it was termed, a phrase we meet with
Cic. Verr. m. 82, where the whole matter is explained. *

10. In quaestum] ‘With a view to gain!

11- quue per ludibrium-..cogebanturJ We adhere
to the readmg of the MSS. aud of Orelli, which Kritz also

retains. We understand the passage as describing one of the
