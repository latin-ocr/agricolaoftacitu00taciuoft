1⁸1on ΟΝ THE LIFE AN D WRITINGS
OF TACITUS.

[amn 01· nothing is known of the life of Tacitus
’ ·except what he tells us himself, or what we may
j gather from the Epistles of his friend, the younger
Pliny. His praenomen is a matter of doubt. It is
commonly written Gaius (on the authority of Sidonius
· Apollinaris), but it is given as Publius in the best
r MS. of the Annals. The name Cornelius suggests a
possible connection with the great patrician Gens

plebeian house of the same name, and it must be
remembered that in the time of the Empire the

regard to his parentage we have at least a probablc

us (Nat. Hisc. vn. 17), acquainted with one Cornelius

name, the coincidence of dates, and the probability
that at some time of 1113 life our author was familiar
’ with the neighbourhood of North-Eastern Gaul, in-
cline us to accept the conjecture, which is further
supported by the fact that the circumstances of his

s birth nothing can be certainly affirmed. It is indeed
ju approximately fixed by several expressions used by
⁸ the younger Pliny. That writer says (Epist. vn. 20)
· that Tacitus and himself were “nearly equal in age
