'72 CORNELII TAOITI AGRICOLA.

’ξ

7. lique] This seems a better reading than eoque, as it ῃ
is not easy to see how the nobility and greatness of a people ζ
should be the cause of their occupying the remotest regions -
(penetralia) of a country. It has been strangely enough sug- .,
gested that there is an implied comparison between such a people ζ

and jewels aud treasures which are stowed away in secret places.

If ‘ eoque' be read, it must mean that an indigenous population was ,

likely to linger longest iu the least accessible parts of a country.

8. servientium litora] Sc. the shores of Gaul.

9· Oculos quoque habebamus] ‘We kept our very
eyes unpolluted by the contagious touch of tyranny.’

10. Sinus famae] We are inclined to think that this ex- ⁴

pression means the protectiou which the fame of their untried
valour had hitherto lent them. The remoteness of their situa-
tion, and all the exaggeration to which this remoteness naturally
gave rise (expressed in the clause, ‘ omne ignotum pro magnifico’),
had hitherto saved them from attack. Now this remoteness had
ceased to be (terminus Britanniae patet). Orelli takes ‘famae'
as a dative dependent on ‘defendit.' Hitherto the remoteness
of their abode (sinus) had saved them from fame, and they had
been undisturbed because they had been unknown.

11. Infestiores.] Sc. more hostile than waves and rocks.

12. AmbitiosiJ Sc. eager for warlike glory. If the enemy
has nothing to tempt their cupidity, they covet the glory of con-
quest sor its own sake.

13. 0pes...con0upiscun†„] ‘Wealth and poverty they
covet with equal vehemence of desire‚’ sc. they spa-re neither the

rich nor poor. Comp. for a similar sentiment, Sallust, Ocu. 11,
avaritia neque copia neque inopia minuitur.

ῐ. Alibi servituri] Sc. to serve elsewhere in the Roman
armies. The degrading word ‘servire’ is of course deliberately
chosen. It appears however that some at least of the British
levies were retained in the island. See Ch. 18, auxiliarium qui·
bus nota vada, and Ch. 32, agnoscent Britanni suam causam.

α. Ager atque annus] This reading (due to Seyffert's
emendation) is adopted by Ritter and Kritz, as coming closest to

the Vatican MSS. which have ‘ aggerat annus,' and as yielding a

good sense. ‘Annus’ is used in the Germ. Oh. 14, for the yearly ,
