WRITINGS OF TAOIT'Us. xiii

August 23, Λα). 93. (See Affinch. 45). It is certain,
however, that he was in Rome during the last period of
’ Domitian's reign. The language in which at the close
of the Ayricola he describes the horrors of that time is
full of the bitterness, and even of the self-reproach of
one who had been compelled to witness and to sanction
by his presence the cruelties of the tyr-ant.

Domitian was assassinated Sept, 18, A. D. 95. Two
years afterwards Tacitus was advanced to the dignity
’ of the Consulship. Verginius Rufus had died in his
year of office, and Tacitus was appointed to succeed
him. He also delivered a funeral oration onhis pre-
decessor. ⁴ ‘ Hic supremus‚'' says Pliny of Rufus
(Epist. ΙΙ. 1), “ felicitati ejus cumulus accessit, laudator
eloquentissimus.”

In A. D. 100 he was appointed together with Pliny,
who was then Consul elect, to conduct the impeach-
ment preferred by the Province of Africa against their
late Proconsul, Marcus Priscus. Pliny, who relates
the trial at length (Epist. 11. 11), describes his oratory
by the epithet σεμνῶς. Here the public life of Tacitus
terminated. We hear indeed in one of Pliny's letters
(VI. 9) of his interesting himself in the candidature of

- one Julius Naso for some public office. We may ga-

ther from the letter that he was not then living at
Rome, and, perhaps, as he was not aware that Naso
had started under the auspices of Pliny, that he knew
but little of what was going on in the capital.

The date of his death is not known, but that he at

⁴· least lived down to the end of Trajan's reign, we may
”· infer from Ann. 11. 61, where he says that the Roman

EmPire ‘⁴ Nunc ad rubrum mare patescit‚” an expres-
sion which must refer to the successes obtained by
Trajan in his Eastern expedition (A. D. 114—117).
