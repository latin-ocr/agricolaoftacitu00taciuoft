54 CORNELII TACI TI AGRIGOLA.

7. Prosperas...praesidiis,] ‘Achieved the success of
subduing tribes,’ διο. Understand the ablatives ‘subactis natio-

nibus' &c. as the epexegesis of ‘ prosperas res.‘ Com p. for a pre-
cisely similar construction Ch. 22, Tertius expeditionum annus
novas gentes aperuit vastatis usque ad Tanaum nationibus.

8. Firmatis praesidiis] ‘Firmase praesidia‘ is to place
them in secure positions.

CHAPTER XV.

1. Britanni accendere] A distinction is to be noted
between ‘agitare' and ‘conferre' The first denotzs discussions
in which all took part, the second, discussions and interviews of
a more private nature. For the expression ‘interpretando ac-
cendere,' comp. Livy, IV. 58, haec sua sponte ayitata insuper
tribuni plebis accendunt. ‘Interpretando' means ‘by discovering
a common meaning or purpose in them!

2. Ex facili] A Graecism. Comp. ex insperato, ex aperto,
ex affluenti &c &a Graecisms were characteristic of the silver
age.

3. Singulos...reges,] Sc. the ‘legatus,’ before the organi-
ἱαέἐὲἳῃῖξέἓίοξὲονίηοθ was complet-ed, and before the procuratore

4· E quibus legatus ...saeviret.] The ‘legatus’ had
the military ‘imperium’ which involved the ‘jus gladii’ and the
power uf inflicting capital punishment. The procurator could
not take judicial cognisance of illegal acts and pass sentence on
them, but it was his business to assess fines and see that they
were paid into the ‘fiscus’ The subjunctive (saeviret) is used
to imply the purpose with which the legatus and procurator
were set over the Britons; this, at least, was the interpretatio
which the Britons themselves put on the matter. The rapacity
of a procurator (Catus Decianus) is mentioned, Ann. XIV. 32, as
the occasion of an outbreak in Britain.

5- Alterius manum...miscere.] The first ‘alterius’
refers to the legatus, the second, to the procurator. The

‘manus' of the legatus were officers and military attendants
selected by him for the performance of special and confidential
services It nearly answers to our ‘staffi’ and it would chiefly
consist of soldiers of a ceuturion’s rank. It is alluded to Ch. 19,
nec ex commendatione aut precibus centurionem, milites ascire,
sed optimum quemque fidelissimum putare, in which passage the
milites are what is here termed ‘manus‘ The ‘servi’ of the
procurator, would be persons employed in collecting fines and
deth, and were probably not soldiers. The passage may be thus
