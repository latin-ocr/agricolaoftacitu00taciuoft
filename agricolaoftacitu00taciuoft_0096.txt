2. Nave prima] This is susceptible of the following ’Ξ
meanings; (1) the first Roman vessel which had visited those a}
parta-13 (2) the first vessel which veutured to sea in the early ζ
spring3 (3) the foremost vessel of the fleet3 (4) the first vessel ‡{
which Agricola had as yet had occasion to employ. Τὴθ choice ’ξ

powerful (valentissimam) part of the world, and the Britons, Ch.
12, are spoken of as validissimae genteS.

7- Magnis invicem usibus miscuerit] ‘Has united
