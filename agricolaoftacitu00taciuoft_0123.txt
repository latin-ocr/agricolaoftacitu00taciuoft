NOTES. ’ 93

Rome. Tacitus, as also Juvenal, IV. 145, terms it ‘ arx,' to imply
'that it was a kind of centre and stronghold of imperial tyranny.
Dio, van. 1, describes it as the emperor's ἀκρόπολις. It was
here that he convoked the ‘pontifices’ to pass sentence of death
on the Vestal, Cornelia. See Plin. Epp. lv. 11. Not till the
·emperor's later years were the counsels (sententia) of Messalinus
(whom Juvenal, IV. 115, describes as Grande et conspicuum
nostro quoque tempore monstrum) heard beyond its walls.

7. Massa, Baebius] See Hist. rv. 50, and Plin. Ep. 111.

4, vx. 29, vn. 33. He was impeached by the province of Baetica
where he had been procurator.

8. Nostrae...manus,] Sc. the hands of us senators, of
whom Tacitus at this time was one.

9- Nos Maurici Rusticique, 8⁶0. ὅσα] Wex, to avoid
the somewhat bold zeugma in the passage as it stands, reads

from the margin of one of the Vatican MSS. Nos Mauricum
Rusticumque divisimus. This is a mere conjecture. Under·
stand after ‘visus‘ some such word as ‘perculit’ or ‘afflixit‘
gg The zeugma seems not too harsh for Tacitus.

10. Quum suspiria nostra subscriberentur] ‘When
our sighs were made matter of accusation? Subseribere (properly

‘to sign one’s name under that of the plaintiff or accuser’) is
continually used by the best writers as equivalent to ‘ accusare‚’
and ‘indices’ or ‘accusatores’ are also termed ‘subswsptoresss
Quintilian, ΧΠ. 8. 8, has the expression subscribere audita (to
make what has been heard the subject os a charge).

11· Denotandis tot hominibus palloribus] comp.
Anu. 111. 5 3, ln hac relatione subtrahi oculos meos melius fuit,

ne denotantibus vobis ora ac metum singulorum ipse etiam viderem
'- eos ac velut deprehenderem. Denotare pallores is to mark out
with a view to destruction the men whose faces are beginning to
turn pale ; and the word ‘denotare' answers to ‘designare‚' which
, is used in a similar way in Cic. Cat. 1. 1. 2, notat et desiynat

oculis ad caedem unumquemque nostrum. It seems clear that
. ‘denotare’ may be thus understood, and therefore Wex's con jec-
. ture, denotandis...pallore oribus (which, though probably Latin,
’ strikes us as awkward) is needless. With this passage may be
aptly compared J uvenal’s description of Domitian's senate (xv. 74),
proceres, In quorum facie miserae magnaeque sedebat Pallor
amicitiae.

12. Rubor...muniebat,] The natural redness of Domi-
tian's countenance (of which Pliny, Paney. 48, and Suetonius,
Domit. 18, both speak) rendered him proof against the ordinary
manifestation of the feeling of shame. Comp. also Hist. lv. 40,
crebra oris confit-*xio pro modestia accipiebatur.
