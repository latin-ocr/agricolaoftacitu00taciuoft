NOTES.

CHAPTER Ι.

ῐ. Anffiqllstus usitatum] Usff'tatum is in attribution to
the noun—infinitivo tradere, tradere being the object of the verb

omisit.

α. quamquam] The word is commonly used to introduce
:indgsligiraeorgl-ausffl ‘quamvis' is generally employed to qualxsy a

3. Incuriosa suorum] ‘Neglectful of its own sons‚’ not
‘glories.’ Comp. Arm. 11. 88, vetera extollimus, recentium in·

curiosi ,- also Hor. 0. 111. 24, 31—2, virtutem incolumem, odimus,
sublatam ex oculis quaerimus invidi.

4. supergressa. θεὴ] ‘Has risen superior to ;' has past
into a region which invidia cannot reaoh. Comp. Arm. XIV. 54,
invidia. infra tuam magnitudinem jacet.

5- Ignorantiam recti et invidiam] ‘Blindness and
hostility to goodness’ (O and B). It is very doubtful, however.

whether invidiam is to be connected with recti. The expression
‘invidia recti’ would scarcely be allowable. The rectum (right)
which the multitude are incapable of discerning is not exactly
the aspect of virtue against which invidia. is felt. And yet the
presence of the singular vitium in the preceding clause compels
us to join the two phrases. Rectum is equivalent here to virtus.
comp. Hist. 111. 51, exempla recti, and lv. 5, recti pervicax.

6- Pronum-magisque in aperto] ‘Pronum' expresses
the inclination of the will; ‘in aperto’ the favouring circum-

stances. Or we may take both phrases as referring to the cir-

cumstances 3 the path to virtue was pronus, sc. not arduus, and
in aperto, sc. not impeditus.

’ ⁷· Sine gratia aut ambitione] ‘Without partiality 0¹⁵
aelf-mmg.’ Gmtia' expresses the bias felt by a writer possibly
towards unworthy persons3 ‘ambitio’ the unprincipled desire for
admoement which would betray him into flattery.
