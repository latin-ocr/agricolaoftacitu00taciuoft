N 0 TES. 85

CHAPTER. XLI.

1. Laudantesj Comp. for a similar use of the participle
Ch. 4, peccantium, Ch. 40, servientium.

2. 111 Moesia, Daciaque. This refers to Domitian’s war
111 Dacia, which was begun by the Dacian chief Decebalus A. D.

δέ. lThe Daci entered Moesia and stormed the winter-camp of
t e egions.

3. In Germania et Pannonia] This appears from Dio,
LXVII. 7, to 110 an allusion to losses sustained by Roman armies

in 1110 territories of the Marcomanni and Quadi.

4. Militares viri] Wex, as it seems, without sufficient
reason reads vici. The MSS. have viri, and the phrase ‘vir

τ. militaris’ is applied to Corbulo, Arm. xv. 26. Sallust too, Cat.
, 45, uses the similar expression ‘homines militares.’

5. Expugnati] A word rarely used of persons, but

“· almost always of towns, fortresses, &c. 'We find however 111
- Livy, xxnI. 30, nec ulla magis vis obsessos quam fames expuy-

navit. A similar use of ἐκπολιορκεῖν (1110 Greek equivalent to ex-
pugpare) occurs 111 Thucyd. 1. 134, τόν Παυσανίαν ἐξεπολιόρκησαν
ιμῳ.

6. Limite imperii] ‘Limes’ denotes the actual fortified
boundary line which had been drawn sor the defence of the
empire against the German and Sarmatian tribes 011 1110 side of
Pannonia and Dacia.

7. Ripa] Sc. the bank of the Danube, which for a consider-
able period had been 111 Roman hands, and was 0110 of the great
boundaries of the empire.

8. Funeribus et cladibus] The first word may be meant
to denote family losses, the second, those of the state. It is

however quite possible that no such distinction is implied, and
that the words are coupled together for the sake of rhetorical

effect, ¹²as the general character of the passage would seem to
sugges .

9- constantiam] ‘Steady bravery.’

10. Ceterorum] So Kritz after H. Grotius, whose emenda.-
tion appears to be the best, though it must be admitted that the
rhythm of the sentence rather halts. The Vatican MSS. have
eorum, after which something appears to have dropped out.

11. verberatas] A strong word, used to imply that a
deep impression was made on the emperor.
