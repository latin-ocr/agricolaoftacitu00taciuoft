N Ο TES. 6'7

¹ Hibernia resembled those of Britain, but that its coasts and har-
, bours were better known than the island itself. This we take to
¹ be the meaning of melius. It would be absurd to suppose that it
ς meant that the coasts of Hibernia were better known than those
’ of Britain. Perhaps ‘ melius cogniti ³ may be rightly rendered,
‘are tolerably well known?

10. AgTicola...exceperat,] The emperor Claudius, accord-
, ing to Dio, Lx. 19, availed himself of a similar mc1dent for the

invasion of Britain, which he undertook at the solicitation of a
refugae chief, Bericus.

'¹ the ‘regulus’ mentioned above.

¹ 3. Amplexus] The word is to be understood in the same

= sense as in Ch. 17, LIagnamque Brigantum partem aut victoria
amplexus est aut bello, and denotes actual campaignS‚ not merely
pians and designs.

4· Infesta hostilis exercitus itinera] This is the read-
-ing of the best MSS. and is followed by Orelli and Kritz. By
‘hostilis exercitus’ we understand the Roman army, whose
’ωλι-81183 (itinera) through an enemy's country would be beset
with danger (infesta). ‘Infestus' often has a passive as well
‚as an active sense.

5. 111 partem vilium] ‘ To form part of his force.’

6. Egregia specie] ‘With a remarkably imposing ap·
pem-auce? Comp. a similar passage Arm. 11. 6, naves augebantur
⁷ alacritate militum in speciem ae terrorem.

7· Impelleretur] ‘Was being hurried on.’

8. Misti copiis et laetitia] ‘Copiae’ here, as Ch· 22
(annuis copiis) and elsewhere, means ‘provisions.’ It is best to
take ‘copiis et laetitia’ as a hendiadis„ The meaning is that the

’ noldiers and sailors mingled in merry gatherings over their meals.

- 9· Ad manus] ‘To force,’ ‘resistance.’

- io. oppugnare] Construe this with ‘adorti‚’ ‘having
attempted to storm,’ &a> 5 2
