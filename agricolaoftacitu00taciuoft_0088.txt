58 CORNELII TAC'ITI AGRIGOLA.

in meaning to alius, and it certainly is unlikely that Tacitus would
even suggest a comparison between Cerialis and Agricola, as by
this interpretation he is made to do. For the expression ‘curam
famamque obruisset' comp. Ch. 46, multos veterum oblivio obruit.
‘obruisset’ (would have completely extinguished) is a stronger
word than obscurasset, by which it has been explained. By

‘molem' we are to understand the difficulty of the work imposed ·

on Frontinus, who had to complete what Cerialis had so ably
begun. Comp. its use Ann. 1. 45, haud minor moles supererat
ob ferociam quintae et vicesimae legionis; Hise. 111. 46, ne ex·
terna moles utrimque ingrueret. There remains some difficulty
about the words ‘quantum licebat-⁹ Their collocation seems to
require that they should be construed with ‘vir magnus‚'
though VVex and Kritz take them with ‘ sustinuit molem‚’ under-
standing them to mean that Frontinus, so far as the difficulties
of his position permitted, carried out the arduous task which
devolved ou him. It is possible however that Tacitus, although
in this very chapter he has admitted that under Vespasian there
were ‘ magni duces,’ may be hinting at that Emperor’s well—known
parsimony which would have the effect of discouraging costly
aud difficult enterprises, or that he may wish to imply generally
that an imperial rcfyz'me is sure to set limite on greatness. Julius
Frontinus had been praetor urbanus. He was probably at this
time a praetorian legatus in Britain, and seems to have com-
manded a legion in a different part of the country from that where
the operatione of Cerialis had been conducted. He was the
author of two works which have come down to us, one on mili-
tary stratagemS, the other, on aqueducts. Pliny (Ep. IV. 8, 3),
speaks of him in high tei-ms.

3· Ad securitatem ...... verterentur] The MSS· fiuc-
tuate between verterentur and uterentur, which latter Orelli reads,

construing it with the ablativo ‘omissa expeditione.' But ‘verti
ad aliquid’ is a well known phrase, aud suits the present passage.
Oomp. Hist. -v. 11, Romani ad oppugnandum versi, Ληη. XIV.

middle sense. There is no zeugma, since verti ad securitatem, verti
ad occasionem, are both legitimate expressions. ‘Securitatem’
‘carelessness ε’ ‘occasionem‚· ‘au opportunity for attack'
