50 CORNELII TAOJTI A GRICOLA.

¹0- Procurrentibus in diversa] Neighboufing countriefl
jutting out in different directions (in diversa) would approximate '

very closely, would occupy nearly the same positio coeli, and so
would be subject to nearly the same climatic influences.

11. In universum aestimanti] Comp. Germ. 6, in um·-
versam aestimanti plus apud peditem robur.

‚12- Superstitionum persuasiones-l S'c. ‘superstitious
belnefs’ The meaning is that both the same rites (sacra) and the

same beliefs prevailed in Britain as in Gaul. Comp. Caes. B. G.
VI. 13. ‘Superstitio' denoted to a Roman ‘any foreiyn religious ’
belief.‘ The reading of the MSS. ‘persuasione’ (retained by
O1e11i) hardly admits of explanation.

¹3· In deposcendis...f0rmid0,] Comp. Caesar B. G. 111.
16, Ut ad bella suscipienda Gallorum alacer ac promptus est

animus, sic mollis ac minime resistens ad calamitates perferendas
mens eorum est.

14· Haeserunt] ‘Displayff

¹5- Gallos quoque in bellis floruisse, ete] comp: Caesar,
B. G. passim, and Cic. De Prov. Consul. 13, Nemo de Republica

nostra sapienter cogitavit jam inde ac principio hujus imperii,
quin Galliam maxime timendam huic imperio putaret.

16. Quales Galli fuerunt] Kritz takes Galli to be the
complement not the subject of the sentence, and would translate

‘ such as they were when Gauls.’ This seems unnecessary. The
meaning is plain enough, if we suppose Tacitus to say—the Grauis
before they were conquered were great warriors3 but military
spirit is incompatible with servitude. Servitude has destroyed it =
in the Gauls, has not yet done so with all the Britons 3 many of
them still remain what the Gauls were.

CHAPTER XII.

1. Et curru proeliantur] Tacitus’ meaning is that their
troops generally consisted of infantry and cavalry, the fortiter

being the stronger force (in pedite robur); and that some tribes
used ohariots as well. Comp. Caesar, B. G. lv. 24, praemisso
equitatu et essedariis. Comp. however, ch. 36, covinnaoius eques,
where the common reading is covinnarius et eques.

α. Honestior auriga, etc] This is the reverse of the
well-known Homerie usage, and that described by Caesar as ¹

practised by the Gauls (loc. cit).

3. Clientes propugnant] The meaning is not that the
eliens (eepd'vrwu) fights in advance of the chariot‚ but that he fights

{li-qm ia· sc. performs the part of the combatant, while the chief
τινος.
