36 CORNELII TACITJ AGRICOLA.

8. Conscientiae] comp. the use of the word in eh. α,
comoieraeiam generis humani, and 42, sive ex conscientia, ne quod
vetuerat videretur emisse. ‘Bonae conscientiae pretium’ is the
feeling that they had acted rightly.

9. Ῑ si] ‘ Ipsorum' would be more strictly grammatical,
but woul clash unpleasantly with ‘ morum ' later on in the sen-
tence. The nominative ‘ipsi' is borrowed from what would be
the equivalent conditional clause, ‘ Si suam ipsi vitam narrarent!
Comp. Sallust, Juq. 18, exercitus, amisso duce, ac passim multis
sihi quisque imperium petentibus, brevi dilabitur.

10. Citra, fidem] Tbat which falls short of (citra) or goes
beyond (ultra) belief (fides) does not meet with credit. Comp-
Germ. 16, citra speciem-:falling short of beauty. For the sub-
ject of autobiography generally comp. Cic. Epist. ad Fam. v.- η,
where the writer says that if his friend Lucceius cannot write
about him, he must write about himself, and would have good
precedente in doing so, and continues thus: Sed quod te non
fugit, haec sunt in hoc genere vitia; et verecundius ipsi de
sese scribant necesse est si quid est laudandum, et praetereant si
qnid reprehendendum est. Accedit etiam ut minor sit fides,
minor auctoritas, eto.

11. At nunc narraturo...temp0ra.] comp. Hist. 1· 1,
Ambitionem scriptoris facile averseris, livor et detrectatio pronis

auribus accipiuntur. Tacitus feels that he might rely on the ac·
ceptance which satire and invective always meet with, and need
not, had these, and not praise, been his theme, have asked for
indulgence. The use of the perfect ‘ fuit’ may be best expressed
by such a pamphi-ase as ‘ Before Ι begin to relate I have found it
necessary, ete? The ‘tempora ' are the times of Domitian. For
‘incusaturus' Ritter reads ‘ incursatumsss He refers the ‘nunc’
to Domitian‘s days, makes ‘venia’ equivalent to ‘leave‚’ and
supposes ‘incursatums’ to mean ‘likely to offend.’ Tacitus thus*
is made to say that he would not have asked for a permission
which would have been likely to offend a rdyim (tempora) that
was hostile to virtue. ‘ F uit’ would then be equivalent to
‘fuisset.’ For the expression ‘infesta virtutibus’ comp. Cic.
Orat. ad Brut. 10. Hoc sum aggressuS, statim Catone absoluto,
quem nunquam attigissem, tempora timens inimica virtuti ; a
curicus parallel to the sentiment of this chapten

1. Legimus] Most probably this means ‘ we read? or ‘it
is recorded in history! But it may be opposed to ‘vidimus‚'
and imply that Tacitus was himself absent and heard only of
these occur-rences. Kritz refers it to the Acca Diurna, and would
understand by it, ‘it was positively recorded (so evil were the
