at great length. He thinks meanly of the reeension

of Puteolanus in the 15th century, on which the
common reading of the text has from that time been

based. He relies chiefly on one of the Vatican MSS.
> of the 151211 century, the work of Pomponius Laetus
and containing on the margin the various readings of
another MS. which are written in the same hand..
Wex's examination of this MS. is subsequent to
that of Orelli and Baiber. of recent editors he has
done the most. for the Agricola. The more recent
edition of Kritz mainly owes its value to Wex.
