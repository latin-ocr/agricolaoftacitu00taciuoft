of the Consulship. During his year of office he
betrothed his daughter (born A.D. 65) to his young
friend. Juveni mihi, says Tacitus, filiam despondit.
Juvenis, like other Latin terms denoting age, is
elastic in its signification, but it is particularly appli-
cable to one who was between his twenty-fifth and
thirtieth year. The marriage was celebrated in the ,
following year, the same in which Agricola assumed
his command in Britain.

The illustrious alliance thus formed was probably
the means of introducing Tacitus to a career of publio
distinction. His elevation, he says (Hist. 1. 1) was
“begun by Vespasian, augmented by Titus, and still
further advanced by Domitian.” What offices he may
have held under the first and second of these princes,
it is impossible to determine. Agricola himself was
Quaestor and Tribune of the People before he reached
the Praetorship. But the Quaestors were employed in
the Provinces. If we suppose Tacitus to have re-
mained at Rome we may conjecture that lie filled
the office of Aedile, and as Vespasian‚ his first patron
died June 23, A.D. 79, that he was appointed to it
early in that year. His next office was probably that
of Tribune of the People, which, as Titus died Sept. 13,
A. D. 81, he must have held either A. D. 80 or in the
following year. We know from his own testimony
(Avm. XI. 11) that he was Praetor A. D. 88, in which
year Domitian celebrated the Ludi Saeculares. In 89
or 90 he left Rome with his wife, and did not return
