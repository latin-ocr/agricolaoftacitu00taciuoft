NOTES. 59

4· Alam in finibus suis agentem] ‘A ‹letachment of
auxiliary cavalry quartered in their territory-⁹ Agere often has

this meaning in Tacitus. Comp. Hist. 1. 74, eas, quae Lugduni
aychant, copiae.
dmg-uetgsstriveratj The word implies sudden and complete

6. tErq‘fffl· provincia] ‘The province was stirred into a
commo lon.

7· Quibus bellum volentibus erat] ‘These who wished
for war.’ A well-known Graecism.

8- quanquam, ὅσα] The clause introduced by quanquam
ends at videbatur.

9. Numeri] Sc. troops not regularly enrolled in the
legion or forming part of it. The word, in the time of the Em-
perors, had come in fact to designate the various forces of infan—

try and cavalry which could not. be strictly included among the

legimaries, though they were attached to them. See Hist. 1. 6,
multi ad hoc numeri, 1. 87, in numeros legionis. The term occurs
from time to time in Pliny and Suetonius.

ιο. Praesumpta ...... quies] ‘Though reposo for that
year had been counted on by the soldiers.' ‘Praesumere’ ‘to

enjoy by anticipation.’ Comp. Αηη. XI. 7, quem illurn tanta
superbia esse ut aeternitatem famae spe praesumat? Pliny (Epp.
lv. 15) uses in this sense the derived noun ‘praesumptio.’ Rerum
quas assequi cupias praesumptio ipsa jucunda est.

ιι. Tarda et contraria] These words are in apposition
with transvecta aestas, sparsi ...... numeri. praesumpta ...... quies,

three sources of delay just mentioned. ‘ Tarda‚’ ‘causing delay.’

η. Custodiri suspecta] ‘That suspected points should
be watched‚’ sc. tribes imperseetly conquered, or likely to revolt.

13. vexillis] By ‘vexilla' are meant what above are
tenned ‘numer-i? They must not be confounded with the ‘ vex·
illarii’ or veterans. Tacitus uses the word elsewhere with this
meaning. Comp. Arm. 11. 78, Piso ...... ‘va-illum tironum in
Syriam euntium intercipit, Hist. 1. 70, Germanorum vexillis, 11.
11, equitum vexilla. In this case, they would appear, from the
mention of auxilia immediately afterwards, to have been Roman
troops, though the term, as it is clear from Hise. 1. 70, was not
restricted to such troops.

14. Erexit aciem] ‘ Led his troops up the hill! Comp.
Ch. 36, eriyere in colles aciem.

15. Instandum famae] ‘That he must follow up the
prestige of success? Comp. Hist. 111. 52, {metandum coeptis3
v. 15, inflare fortunae.
