N 0 ΓΕΒ. 77

7. Quos quod-..restiterunt.] ‘Thala-you have, at last
found them is not because they have stood theu· ground, διο.

8. Novissimae res...aoiem.] This is the reading of both
the Vatican MSS. and, though harsh‚ is intelligible. ‘Their

desperate fortunes and their bodies in the extremity of panio have
rivetted their line to this spot‚’ διο. Comp. for the use of ‘no-
vissimae' Germ. 24, extremo ac novissimo jactu. ‘Defixere' vividly
expresses the paralysis of terror. Kritz, in his 2nd edition, adopts
the ingenious conjecture of Schoemann, novissimae res et extre-
mus metus torpore defixere, &Q

9. Victoriam ederetis] The expression ‘edere victoriam’
derives its meaning from the epithets attached to victoriam, and

it conveys the notion of ‘ exhibiting on a grand scale.'

· 10- Transigite cum expeditionibus-l ‘Make an end of
campaigns.’ ‘Transigere ' is a legal word, and denotes the settle·

ment of a suit. Comp. Germ. 19, cum spe votoque uxoris semel
transiyitur.

11. ImRODthn-diem] ‘Crown fifty years’ service with
a great day. Forty-two years, from ΑΔ). 43 (the date of Clau-

dius’s expedition), was the precise period.

12. Mox-as belli] Sc. carrying on war without energy, or
wilfully protracting it. Comp. what is said of Vocula, Hist. IV. 34.

¹3· Caussas rebellandi] This phrase would naturally
mean the wrong doings of the dominant race. Comp. Ch. 19,

doctus per aliena experimenta parum profici armis si injuriae se-
querentur, caussas bellorum statuit excidere. But how was the
army to shew upon a. battle-field that it was guiltless of such
practices? Perhaps we should understand by ‘caussae’ the pre-
texts or suggestions of possible rebellion which the carelessness of
the conquerors might give, or which were the effective causes of
rebellion. The soldiers were to do their work so thoroughly that
there should be no strength left for rebellion.

GH APTER XXXV.

1. Affunderentur] This word (where we should have ex-
pected simply adderentur) seems intended to denote the rapid
movements of cavalry.

2. Ingens...bellandi,] ‘Bellandw the reading of the best
MSS„ must be eonstrued with ‘decus‚' and ‘victoriae’ seem

best taken as the dative. If the legions sustained no loss, this

would add to the victory the great glory of fighting without ahod·
ding the blood of Roman soldiers.
