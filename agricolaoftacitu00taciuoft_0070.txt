7. Peccantium] ‘Peccare’ denotes here ‘sins of licen·
tiousness.’ as commonly in the Roman poets; comp. Hor. 0. 111. .’
xix. 20, peccare docentes historias.

8. Sedem ac magistram] ‘The scene and guide' (0 and B).
The place is said, as, by a common metaphor, Oxford or Cam-

quentiae, quam cernebat animo, re ipsa non videbat.

14- Vehementius quam caute] 'Phe classical usage
