48 CORNELII TACJTJ 'melcol-,a

6· Romana notitia] ‘Roman geographyss

7. Spasslo ac coelo, etc] ⁴ Spatium’ means ‘extent‚’
‘coelum, ‘geographical position: as astronomically and scienti-
fically determined. There is a reference to the division of the
earth into zones. It seems that Tacitus (in common with other
writers) believed both Spain and Germany to extend much fur-
ther to the north than they actually do. On this supposition his
meaning in this sentence would be that Britain lies opposite to
Spain on the west, to Germany on the east, and to Gaul on the
south ς but that in the two former cases the distance is so con-
siderable that the fact has to be inserted from certain considera·
tions (expressed by the words spatio ac coelo), whereas in the case
of Gaul it was a matter of ocular demonstration, Gallis etiam
inspicitur. It will be remembered that Tacitus included Scandi-
navia. in what he called Germany.

8. Nullis contra terris] Comp. Caesar, B. G. 11. 14.
Tertium latus est contra septemtrionem, cui parti nulla est

objecta tewa.

9. oblongae scutulae, etc] it is not easy to see what
conception Tacitus had formed of the shape of Britain. He

seems to have shared the passion for discovering resemblances
common to the ancient geographers. It has been doubted whe-
ther scutul'a means a ‘dish,’ or a mathematical figure; and,
taking the later supposition, whether it signifies a rhombus, a
rhomboid, or a trapezium. We incline to the latter opinion,
and may imagine the southern shore to be the longest side of
the trapezium. The opposite or northern boundary would be
the shortest. This figure would bear some resemblance to the
bipennis, if we suppose the {ron head only of that weapon to be
intended. But from this northern boundary, which one might
have supposed to be the extreme limit of the country (extremo jam
littore) there extended a vast projection, narrowing in a wedge-
like shape (in cuneum). Excluding Caledonia (citra Caledoniam)
the country was like a scutula or bipennis.

ιο. In universum fama est transgressa] The MSS-
favour the reading ‘in universum‚’ which the sense seems to

demand. Because this resemblance is real as to part of the
island, it has been supposed to be so about the whole. ‘Uni-
versis‚’ which Orelli reads, and which he interprets in this way⁷
can hardly bear such a meaning. Kritz reads ‘transgressis,’
which he takes to mean ‘among those who have crossed over
[from the continent into Britain].’ This strikes us as a very
questionable rendering.

B 'tlaln Hanc oram] i.e. the wedge-like projection of northern
rl .
¹2. Novissimi maris] 'Ibe furthest sea. Comp. Hiet. v,
