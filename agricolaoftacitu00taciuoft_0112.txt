82 CORNELII malm Ae'ffloom.

10. Borestorum] The name occurs nowhere else. *The
tribe of the Boresti must have dwelt to the north of Bodotria,
possibly in Fife.

11. Vires] ‘A military force?

12- Secunda tempestate ac fama] ‘With favourable
weather and great renown.’

13- Unde proxima-redierat] ‘Unde’ is to be con-
strued with ‘lecto‚’ not, as might seem at first sight, with

‘redierat.’ The meaning of this somewhat obscurely expressed
clause is that the fleet started on its cruise from the ‘Trutulensis
portus,¹ to which it returned. By ‘ proximum Britanniae latus’
must be meant the shores adjacent to Bodotria, that is, the east
coast of Scotland. It seems clear that the ‘Trutulensis portus*
must have been some point at no great distance from Bodotria.
The voyage here described has been alluded to Ch. 10. Without
being a circumnavigation of Britain, it was enough to prove the
country to be an island.

CHAPTER XXXIX.

1. Auctum] The MSS. have ‘ actum,q which seems utterly
indefensible, though one or two editors retain and endeavour to
explain it. Auctum (the correction of Lipsius) is read by nearly
all recent editors.

2- Ut Domitiano moris erat] Gomp- fol-'similar con·
struction Germ. 13, arma sumere non cuiquam mores, Germ. 2 ι,

4, and Suet. Dom. VI. The first tells us that Domitian marched

with an army into Germany and returned without even the sight
of an enemy. Suetonius speaks of sundry engagements (varia
praelia) ou the strength of which he celebrated a twofold triumph
(duplicem triumphum) over the Chatti and Daci. Pliny in his
Panegyric, Ch. 16, contrasts the genuine triumphs of Trajan’s
reign with the mimici cun-us and falsae simulacra victoriae of a
former period. Comp. also Germ. Ch. 37, ingentes O. Caesaris
minae in ludibrium versae, and see note 22.

5. At nunc, veram, ὅσα] The infinitives in this and the
following sentences depend on inerat conscientia..
