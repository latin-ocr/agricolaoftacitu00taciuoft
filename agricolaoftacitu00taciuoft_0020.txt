strains too much after effect, 116 is on the whole a far
more natural and straightforward writer than most
of his contemporaries,

It has been usual to reg-ard Cicero as the repre-
sentative of the most perfect Latinity, and Tacitus as
a man of genius belonging to a declining age and in-
fected by many of its chief literary vices. This view
ignores several important considerations and requires
some correction. It is true that the style of Cicero,
from its general conformity to certain precise and
definite rules, is fitted to be a model of Latinity in a
sense in which that of Tacitus cannot be. A modern
scholar feels instinctively that the first is much more
suitable for imitation, but it is, we think, a great mis-
take to claim on this ground for Cicero a distinct supe-
riority over Tacitus. Cicero indeed was enabled by his
great abilities and wide culture to give a richness and
flexibility to the Latin language which it had not
known before his time, and we may venture to affirm
that without him there could not have been a Tacitus.
If, however, we are to measure excellence of style by
its capacity of adequately representing the profound and
subtle ideas of a really great thinker, we shall see good
reason for placing Tacitus in at least as high a rank as
Cicero. In vividness of imagination, in insight into
the intricacies of human character, in the breadth and
comprehensiveness of his historical faculty, he stands
first among Roman writers. These qualities are con-
tinually reflected in his style. In the language of the
time, permeated as it was with Greek ideas and
phrases, he found an instrument ready to his hand3
he used it with a consummate mastery of its various

- resources‚ and succeeded in giving to great thoughts 6

singularly characteristic expression.
