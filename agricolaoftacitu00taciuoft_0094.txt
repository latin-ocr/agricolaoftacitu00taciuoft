64 CORNELII TAOITI AGRICOLA.

‘he trained the natural powers of the Britons up to a hig·he1·-!5

point thau had been reached by the industry of the Gauls.’ He =

thus makes ‘ anteferre' equivalent to ‘ promovere‚’ a use of the
word to which we ean find no parallel.

5· Delenimenta vitiorum] ‘Attractive accompaniments ,

οἰ vice.’

6. Apud imperitos] ‘Imperiti’ are here persons who
looked at the matter merely from the surface.

7. Humanitas] ‘Oivilisationss

8. Pars servitutis] comp. for a like sentiment Hist. ’

lv, 64, Instituta cultumque patrium resumite, abruptis volupta-
tibus, quibus Romani plus adversus subjectos quam armis valent.

CHAPTER XXII.

1· Tertius-..annus.] A.D. 80.

2. Tanaum] This is the reading of the MSS„ for which
Orelli and ltitter read Taus, after Puteolanus from a marginal
gloss in one of the MSS„ and understand by it the trith of Tay.
We think it unlikely that Agricola had as yet advanced so far
north. His campaign of this year, we have little doubt, was
confiued to the country south, of Bodotria, the frith of Forth,
which he does not appear to have crossed till his 6th year (see
Ch. 25). Nor again can we think that by the Taus is meant the
Tweed, to which the word ‘ aestuarium' could be hardly applied.
Agricola too by this time had probably pushed into Caledonia.

Perhap3, as suggested by WeX‚ we are to understand the mouth ’

of the North 'l'yne at Dunbar. The fact that ‘ Tan' is a. Keltic
name for running water confirms the reading ‘ Tanaus.’

3· Conflictatum saevis tempestatibus-l (pomp. Hist.
ΙΙΙ. 59, sed foeda hieme per transitum Apenmm conflzctatms exer-

citus.fil ‘Shattered’ is perhaps the best English equivalent to
‘con 'otatus.’

4· Periti] ‘ Men of experience.’

5. Pactione] So. ‘capitulatiom’

6. Annuis copiis] ‘With provisions for the year!
Comp. Ch. 2 5, mixti copiis et laetitia.

7· Sibi quisque praesidio.] Understand by ‘quisque'
every commander of a ‘ castellum.'

8- Hibernis eventibus] ‘By successes in winter) Comp.
Ch. 8, majoribus copiis ex eventu praefecit, ‘ eventus ’ being used

for a prosperous result.
