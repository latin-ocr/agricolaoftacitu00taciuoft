44 CORNELII TACITI A GRIOOLA.

17. Electus a, Galba] For an account of a similar mea-
sure of Galba‘s comp. Hist. 1. αθ, where we hear os the appoint-

ment of commissionem charged with the duty of recovering some ⁴

of the prodigal bounties 'of Nero.

18. Sensisset] The force of the pluperfect may be thus
explained. He so ordered things that when his office was dis-
charged it might be said that the state had received no injury
(or, it may mean, had contracted no gunt), except from the irre-
mediable wrongs which Nero had inflicted. Comp. Plin. Pancy.
40, ‘Idem effecisti ne malos principes habuissemus) Under
Trajan’s rule the evils of former misrule had ceased to exist.
By a bold figure Rome—so entirely had she recovered—might
be said, not. even to have had bad Emperors.

CHAPTER VII.

¹· Nam classis Othoniana, ete] For the account of
these events see Hist. 11. 12, 13. Tacitus would probably have

heard lphe details which he there gives from hie father—in-law.
2. Licenter.] ‘For purposes of plunder?

fh} Intemelios,] Now Vintimiglia, about twelve miles E.
o onaco.

4· Quae causa caedis fuerat] We should rather expect
‘qu0d.‘ But the meaning is that whatever of her moveable inhe-

riced property she had on the spot was plundered, and that. it
was this that had invited the crime.

5. Solemnia pietatis] ‘The solemn duties of filia] affec-

tion! The funeral would have been performed hastily, but some ,

of the ceremonies could be repeated with more solemnity. Oomp.
Cic. pro cluent. 9, where we are told of a mother, who finding
that her son was dead, and his corpse already hurnt, repeated the
funeral rites (de infiegro funus jam sepulto filio fecit).

6. Affectati a Vespasiano imperii] ¹ This event took
place in the beginning of J uly, ΑΔ). 69 ; see ῌιθί. 11. 79.

7· Deprehensusfl ‘Overtaken.'

Mucianus] Comp. Hist. xv. 11, ‘Muciamus urbem in-
gressus cuncta. simul in se traxit? For the character of Vespa-
sian's chief lieuteiiant see Hist. 11. 5.

8· EX paterna fortuna, eto] ‘From his father's eleva-
tion seeking merely to practise (usurpare) licentiousness! Oomp.

Hz‘st. 1v. 2, ‘ stupris et adulteriis filium Principis agebat?

9· Juvene admodum Domitiano.] comp. msa-111.. 79,
where Flavius Sabinus speaks of him as filium Vespasxam vm

puberem. He was in his eighteeuth year.
