N OPES. 89

cio. Brutus, 66, 233, omnia magna voce dicens, verborum sane
bonorum eursu incitato, ita furebat tamen ut mirarere tam alias
m aym populum ut esset insano inter disertos locus. Comp.
also Pliny, Pancy. 5 tibi (sc. Trajano) quanquam non id aymtium,
civium clamor occurrit.

4. Fora] Sc. what the Freneh call les places publiques.

5. Circulos] Sc. little knots or gatherings for gossip.

6. Locuti sunt] ‘Talked of him! Understand ⁴eum.’
Comp. Arm. XVI. 22, te, Nero, et Thraseam civitas loquitur.

7. Constans rumor] Sc. a generally current and un-
eontradicted repert. Dio, LXVI. 20, positively assei-ts its truth.

Suetonius however does not include Agricola in the number of

senators and men of consular rank put to death by Domitian
(Suet. Domit. ιο).

8· Nobis nihil comperti affirmare ausim] ‘1 would
venture to affirm that we have no certain knowledge.' We

· have followed the reading of the MSS. according to which ‘esse’

³· must be understood after ‘comperti' lf this reading is correct,

Tacitus appears to mean that all he ean state positively is that
to himself the whole affair was wrapped in obscurity. In the
two following sentences he insinuates the worst3 in this, he
leaves it an open question, on which others may make up their
minds, if they can. Ritter and Wex emend the passage; the
first inserts ut, the second quodve, after ‘comperti’ As it stands,

¹ it is certainly somewhat obscure. There is however no real

difficulty about the sudden change from the plural to the singular
in ‘nobis, ausim.’ Instances of this are by no means rare. Comp.
Arm. XIV. 4 3, simul quidquid hoc in nobis auctoritatis est, crebris
contradictionibus destruendum non eaeistimabam.

9. Principatus] Sc. the imperial court.

10. Medicorum intimi] Comp. Arm. Π. 3, where in
the account of Sejanus’s plot against the life of Drusus, Livia,

the wife oi the latter, is said to have made a ‘confidant’ of one
Eudemus, a physician (sumitur in conscientiam Eudemus, amicus
ac medicus Liviae, specie artis frequens secretis).

ι 1· Inquisitio-1 ⁸ Espionage:

¹2· Momenta ipsa deficientis] ‘Momentum’ answers
to ῥοτὴωιὰ denotes (1) the turn of the scale, (2) the critical
moment at which the turn takes place. Hence here it signifies

all the various aymptoms of approaching death.

13· Per dispositos cursores] Sc. macnengen between
Rome and Domitian’s ‘ villa Albana,’ on which see ch. 45.
