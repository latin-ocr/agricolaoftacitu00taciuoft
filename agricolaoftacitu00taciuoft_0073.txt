NOTES. 43
8. Mutuam dissimulationem-l ‘A mutual conoeaJment

¹ of guilt’ &0 and B). Comp. Hist. 1. 72, vica impunitatis, and

Plin. Epp. lx. 13, Senatus severus in ceteros senatoribus solis
dissimulatimae quasi mutua parceret.

9. Subsidium] This possibly refers ιο the advantage
which a candidate derived from having children. Comp. sinn. 11.
51, plerique nitebantur ut numerus liberorum in eandzdam prae-
polleret. This would be ιο carry out the provisions of the-lex
Papia Poppaea. We prefer ιο give it a more general signification.

10. Sublatam] ‘ Born‚’ a phrase derived from the custom
by which a Roman father took up (sustulit) the child whom he
acknowledged, and wished to rear.

11. Brevi amisit] This does not necessarily mean what
Ritter understands by it, that the son died before the daughter
was born. In that case we should rather have expected ‘ ami-
serat) The daughter was a ‘ subsidium,‘ as increasing his family,
and when he lost his son became a ‘solatium'

η. uibus inertia ...... fuit] Comp. Tacitus’ account of
Galba, isc. 1. 49, metus temporum obtentui fuit, ut quod

nequitia erat sapientia vocaretur. In Agricola's case the ‘segnitia'
was of course assumed

13. Tenor et Silentium] ‘ consistent quietude’ (0 and B);
‘ tenor’ is the correction of the MS. reading ‘ certior!

14- Neque enim jurisdictio obvenerat] There were
twelve or more praetore, two of whom only, the praetor urbanus

and the praetor peregrian had judicia] sunctions. Agricola did
not happen to hold either office.

Ι5· Ludos et inania honoris- .. duxit-l ‘The gamee
and the pageantry of his office he ordered according to the mean‘

(C and B). It is possible that ‘ducere' may be equivalent to
‘edei-ej with special reference to the procession, the notion of
which would be included in the word ‘ ludi,’ and which would be
expressed by the phrase ‘ducere pompam.¹ It seems better, how-
ever, to connect ‘duxit‘ closely with ‘ medi0‚' as if Tacitus meant
to say ‘ he conducted them along the middle course.’ Ritter con-
siders it to be equivalent to ‘arbitratus est,’ but to make out
this view he has to adopt the violent course of substituting for
¹ medio rationis' Lipsius’ conjecture of moderationis.

16. Famae propior] Sc. rather gaining distinction from
them than otherwise. Though the exhibition was not prodigally
ostentatious, there was enough splendour about it to attract admi-
ration. Tacitus, it will be remembered, was himself praetor, and
in that capacity presided over the Ludi Saeculares exhibited by
