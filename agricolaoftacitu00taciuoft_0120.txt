90 CORNELII TAOITI AGRIOOLA.

14. Animo vultuque] It is not necessary to explain this
as a hendiadis. ‘Animus' denotes the frame of mind which

Anclines a person to the usual manifestations of grief, ‘vultus,'
its expression in the countenance. Domitian’s assumed grief,
showed itseli not merely in his looxs but in his general demean-
our.

15. Securus jam odii] ‘ Being now careless of his hatred?
Domitian was now free from the anxiety with which his hatred
of Agricola. had filled him. Consequentiy, being at ease in his
mind, he could, in spite of his natural irascibility‚ so far control
himself as to exhibit a show of sorrow. This he could not do as
long as he was afraid.

16. Goheredem] This probably implies that Agricola
made the emperor heir to half his estate.

17. Piissimae] A form disapproved by writers of the
Augustan age. Cicero (Philip. xm. 19) twits M. Antonius with
having used it in reference to Lepidus.

‚¹8³ Velut honore judicioque-l ¹ (he‘if'as greatly pleased)
as 1f it were a comphment and a free choice) Domitian in

this instance followed the example of such emperors as Caligula
and Nero, to the latter of whom Prasutagus, king of the Iceni,
and husband of Boadicea, paid the same compliment with the
same hope as Agricola, See Ann. XIV. 31· Comp. also Arm. xw.

legacies from those who had children, would afterwards claim
a deceased person’s estate on the slightest evidence. See Suet.
Dom. 9, 12. Pliny (Paney. 43) speaks of the ‘security of our
wills’ as one of the happy features of Trajan's reign. „For ‘j udicio’
comp. Suet. Octav. 66, where it is said of Augustus, that, though
he refused to accept any legacy from strangers, amicorum tamen
suprema judicia morosissime pensitavit.

OHAPTER XLIV.

1. Decentior] ‘ Decens’ denotes grace and symmetry of
figure. The French translator Louandre thus renders the pas-
sage ; Sa taille etait bien proportionnee sans etre haute. ,

f 2. Nihil metus in vultu] So Orelli and Wex. Tho
MSS. vary. One has nihil metus et impetus, which can hardly

be the true reading, though Kritz adopts it. ‘Metus' here, as
elsewhere, dcnotes that which causes sear. Comp. Quintil. Instit.
VI. 2, ἰι metum duplicem intelligi volo, quem patimur, et quem
facimus. Possibly a contrast may be intended between Agricola
and Domitian whom Pliny (Paney. 48) describes as ‘visu terribilis:
