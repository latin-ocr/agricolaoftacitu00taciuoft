46 CORNELII TAOITJ AGRIOOLA.

'2- Inter patricios· ascivit] Comp. for the phrase Arm.
XI. 25, ‘Iisdem diebus m ‘numerum patriciorum ascivit Caesar

vetustissimum quemque e senatu, etc.’ The passage is worthy of

note as showing the exhaustion, indicated by the new names'

which we meet with in Tacitus, of the old and even of the more
recent Roman aristocracy,

3- splendidae dignitatis] Agenitive of quality. For
a similar construction comp. in this chapter, eqreqiae spei filiam.

4. Administratione] ‘ From the importance of its duties!

5· Spe consulatus] Galba had passed in like manner
from the govemment of Aquitania to the consulship. Oomp.

Suet. Galba, 6.

t· 6. Subtilitatem] Sc. the faculty of drawing nice distinc-
1ons.

7. Secura] ‘ Summary,' sc. that has not the sear of appeals
before it. ‘Obtusior,’ ‘somewhat blunt,' sc. careless of refine-
ments, aiming at· practical rather than theoretical justice.

8. calliditatem] The word is here used in a bad sense,
as Cic. De Off 1. 19, ‘Scientia quae est remota a justitia calli-
ditas potius quam sapientia est appellanda.'

9. Quamvis inter togatos] That is, though acting as
a judge among civilians, who would be keen to detect faults and

possibly prejudiced. For this use of togatos comp. Hisc. 11. 20,
toyatos adloqueretur.

10. Jam vero] ‘And besides ς’ comp. ch. 21, Jam vero
principum filios erudire.

11. Divisa] ‘Were kept distinct! Comp. for the use of
the words ‘curae‚‘ ‘remissiones,’ in contr-ast Dial. de Orac. 28,
ac non studia modo curasque, sed remissiones etiam.

12 Conventus] ‘Days of session,’ when the more im-
portant trials would be taken.

13. Persona] An affectation ς a character artificially kept
up as on the stage.

¹4· Tfistitiam...exuerat,] ‘ He was altogether without)
Omnij rm. vl. 2 5, Agrippina feminarum vitia exuerat. ‘Avaritia

must mean something that might coexist with the integritas and
abstinentia spoken of below ; as, ας. an excess in striotness
about the revenue, the fault of Galba, who is said to have been
publicae pecuniae avarus.

15. Referre] ‘To mention ς’ comp. Hist. 1. 30, neque enim
relatu virtutum in comparatione Othonis opus est.
