NUTES. 91

3. 'Gratia oris supererat] ‘A gracious expression pre·

, dominatod’ (0 and B). ‘ Superesse’ has a similar meaning ch. 4 5,

perfunctus est tertio consulatu ut summum fastigium privati

His reason for so doing, that Agricola could not be pronounced
happy because his daughter and wife survived him and were thus
ς destined to see the evil days which he escaped‚ seems far-fetched.
' It must have been at least a comfort to him, as pointed out in

‚ itlllne next chapter, to have had his wife by his side during his last
ness.

11. Nam sicuti...ominabatur‚] Ritter's emendation of
, this passage (which he accomplishes by substituting quondam for
³ {lwdzffiffiffffl{zffssmfflgffi Yssfflffisssss Ῑῗζὲἓῖὲὸἓίριῖἓῖ
luce, as this is the regular construction with durare. There is, it
” «must be admitted, considerable difficulty about the expression
‘durare ominabatur‚’ which may however be compared with a
ῥ passage in Hist. Ι. 50, erant qui Vespasianum et anna Orientis
ἶ auyurarenlnr. It may too be justified by the fact that sperare,
’ a similar word, is occasionally construed with the present infini-
’· tive. According to Dio, me. 12 (and Plin. Paney. 5, 94),
7 Trajan's elevation was foretold two years before Agricola’s death,
and to this Tacitus perhaps refers in ‘augurio.’ Or we may
’ὲ render ‘Trajanum’ by our expression ‘a Trajan! ‘Augur-io
τ votisque ominabatur’ is equivalent to ‘augurabatur et vehe-
.{, ,menter optabat!
