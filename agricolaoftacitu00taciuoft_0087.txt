18. civilium armorum] The civil wars which followed
“ the death of Nero. Α. D. 69, (ι) between Galba and Otho, (2) be-
tween Otho and Vitellius, (3) between Vitellius and Vespasian.

19. Discordia laboratnm] ⁴ Troubles arose from mutiny?
See Ch. 7, aud Hm. 1. 60, which passages shew that the aliusnon is

to the quar-tels between Trebellius, and Coelius who commanded
the ‘zoth legion. Tacitus, however, says Hist. Ι. 9, non sane
aliae legiones per omnes civilium bellorum motus innocentius

egerunt.

q 20. Quum assuetus lasciviret] “When a· soldiery
accustomed to campaigns were demorahsed by mdolence.’

⁴ 21. Praecario praefuit] ‘Governed on sufferancess

22. Vettius Bolanus] See Hist. 11. 65. 97. Bolanus was
sent ΔΑ). 70 to Britain by Vitellius, and under him Agricola

commanded the zoth legion. Comp. Ch. 8.
’13- Agitavit Britanniam disciplina.] Sc. he undertook

J no campaigns, which would have required the enforcement of
“ strict discipline among the troops.

24. Petulantia] ‘ Insubordinatiou,’ such as would lead to

“ wauton outrages.

25. Innocens] The word especially denotes, ‘free from
the guilt of rapacity.’ In this respect Bolanus was a contrast to
Trebellius who is said (Hist. Ι. 60) to have been per avaritiam ac
sorde contemptus enercitui invisusque.

1. RecuperavstJ ‘Restored to unity.’ There is a re-
ference in the word to the civil wars which had distracted the
world, and also, it would seem, to Vespasian‘s superiority over
his predecessors, which almost gave him a right to empire. He
seemed, as it were, to recover what was his own.

2. Aut victoria bello] Sc. either conquered or rav-
aged. 11 he was not successful everywhere he fought everywhere;

» nothing escaped his reach (amplexus).

3- Et Cerialis licebat] Orelli’s correction sed sus-
tinuit, &c- (which we have adopted) is the simplest, though there

is a strong probability that there is a considerable lacuna after

, obruisset. We incline to think that by acterius successoris Fron-

tinus is meant, and not Agricola, as Wex insiste, on the ground
that ‘alter' cannot be used for ‘alius' Ee says that ‘alter
suceessor’ esu mean only secundus a Ceriali, that is, Agricola.
Ι 1t seems too much to asser-t that in uo ease can alter approach
