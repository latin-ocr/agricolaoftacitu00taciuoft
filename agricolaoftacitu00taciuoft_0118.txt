88 CORNELII TAOITI AGRIOOLA.

authority! Possibly in this sentence and in the words ‘inani ’

jactatione’ there is an indirect allusion to some of the extreme
affectations of Stoicism.

2 3. Modestiam] ‘ Quiet, orderly demeanour? Along
with this the idea of seis-control is implied.

24. Eo laudis excedere] 'Rise to that degree of dis-
tinction) ‘ Excedere’ denotes the transcending ordinary limite.
Lipsius needlessly conjectured ‘ escendere.’

25. Per abrupta] ‘By steep (and, consequently, danger-
ous) paths.’ The meaning of the phrase is explained and illus-
trated by a passage in Arm. Π. 20, an liceat inter abruptam con-
tumaciam et deforme obsequium pergere iter ambitione ac peri-
culis vacuum. The notion of ‘abrupta contumacias as here of

per abrupta, is a defiant disregard of au that custom and public
opinion sanction and require.

26. Ambitiosa morte inclaruerunt] ‘Have become
famous by a death intended sor effect.’ Ambitiosus, ‘desirous to

win applause3' ambitiosae preces (Hist. 11. 49), ‘prayers very
anxious to gain their end,’ hence ‘ importunate.’ Comp. Oh. 29,
quem casum neque ambitiose ...... tulit, and see note 2.

1. Finis Vitae, 8⁶0. &ej Comp. this and the following
chapters with Cicero’s remarks on the death of Lucius Crassus

(Cic. De Orat. 111. 2, 3), a passage which Tacitus would seem to
have had in his mind.

2. Extraneis] Sc. Those who were neither relatives nor
intimate friends. The death of Germanicus excited similar grief.
See Arm. 111. 1, 2, where it is said ‘idem omnium gemitus ; neque
discerneres proximos alienos!

3· Vulgus et hic aliud agens populus] No marked
distinction is mtended between vulqus and populus. Both words

denote the lowest and poorest class, as in Dialoq. 7, vulqus im-
peritum et tunicatus hic populus (tunicatus meaning those who
were too poor to wear the ‘ toga,’ comp. Hor. Epp. 1. 7, 65, tuni-
cato popello) and as in Hisc. Ι. 89, ‘indque et magnitudine nimia
communium curarum expers populus. Oomp. also Hist. 11. 90,
vulqus vacuum curis. These passages explain and illustrate the
meaning of ‘aliud ayems' which implies inattention and indiffer-
ence to public events, and is thus almost equivalent to ‘incuri-
osus-⁷ The phrase ‘ alias res agere’ means “to be inattentive to
the matter in hand.” See Ter. Eun. 11. 3, 57, alias res agis 3
